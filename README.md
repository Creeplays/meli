# meli

Meli is supposed to be a faster alternative to docker-compose. Faster in the sense that, Meli will try to pull as many services(docker containers) 
as it can in parallel.

Meli is a Swahili word meaning ship; so think of Meli as a ship carrying your docker contatiners safely across the treacherous container seas.

It's currently work in progress.
